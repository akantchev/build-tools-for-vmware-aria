# General
## This file contains glob patterns for file paths to be ignored during compilation, packaging and testing.
## The file will be (re)generated when the project is rebuilt to maintain the default categories and patterns, ignoring blank lines and repeating comments.
## The default categories, defined as rows starting with a single '#', are 'General', 'Packaging', 'Compilation', 'Testing', 'TestHelpers'.
## Patterns not under one of those categories will be considered in the 'General' category and ignored during all operations.
## Patterns must be listed on separate rows (without in-line comments), can be negated with a single '!' at the start and will be trimmed before processing.
## The 'TestHelpers'category will contain these two patterns by default: '**/*_helper.js', '**/*.helper.[tj]s'
## Rows starting with '##' are considered as comments and will be ignored on processing.
## The following pattern is included to demonstrate ignoring files matching patterns in the General section:
**/*.ignrTtl.[tj]s
# Packaging
## Files with these paths will not be included in the vro package.
## For Workflows, Configurations, Resources and Policies: it is recommended to use the 'General' category (will skip xml element generation).
## Otherwise the patterns below must be based on the _element name_.element_info.xml files in target/vro-sources/xml.
## Note: ignoring files on package cannot be demonstrated under vrotsc/e2e, only Compilation and General
# Compilation
## Files with these paths will be compiled without TS definitions
## The following pattern is included to demonstrate ignoring files matching patterns in the Compilation section:
**/*.ignrCmp.[tj]s
# Testing
## Files with these paths will be excluded from test coverage
## Note: ignoring files on test cannot be demonstrated under vrotsc/e2e, only Compilation and General
# TestHelpers
## Files with these paths will be included in the tests but will not have TS definitions and will not be included in the test coverage or the vro package
**/*_helper.js
**/*.helper.[tj]s
